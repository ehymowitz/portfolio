        Hilary is a Singaporean-Canadian actor and host passionate about art
        that brings people together and gives a voice to the unheard. As a
        third-culture-kid, she loves the possibilities that performance offers
        for cultures to connect. Prior to LASALLE's BA (Hons) Acting program,
        she studied psychology at McGill University, Canada, inspiring her to
        explore the link between performance and mental health. Offstage,
        Hilaryâ€™s passions extend to the outdoors. An avid rock climber, you can
        find her camping by a crag on her latest travels. Pursuing her many
        passions through the arts, Hilary engages audiences on stage and on
        screen with each project she takes on.
